# EDA for Epidemic of Obesity
Part 1: Data
#The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data is a telephone survey in the U.S. and all U.S. territories. The data collection method is uniform and random. The goal of this survey is to collect data on preventative health factors and risky behavior that have been linked to injuries, chronic illness, and disease. This would be a generalized analysis to link many factors that affect a person’s health. This is an observational study conducted by the BRFSS.

#Part 2: Research questions
Authors Hammond and Levine analyze the types of economic costs associated with obesity. They describe 4 types of costs that impact the economy linked to obesity. These are medical, transportation, productivity, and human capital. They specifically link five types of diseases to obesity including stroke, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, and diabetes. I want to analyze these five links listed in their’ analyses.
